# Weather-App
This Weather App has been created by Kevin Jerome and includes the following features
- The ability to show the current temperature , wind speed, and humidity of a city entered into the search bar
  - Using a fetch request for the OpenWeather API each city is found using longitutde and latitude for the location from there the city's name is found and the weather information is displayed.
  -the console log is used to locate the path names and locations to access the API's data.
  -the temperature is located and converted to imperial units for user experience.

The app is currently missing some intended capabilities
  - displaying the weather condition of the city that is being searched.
  - saving user data in local storage to display previously searched cities underneath the search bar
  - 5 Day forecast to see future weather conditions
